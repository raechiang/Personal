# Gongfu Timer (WIP)
This is a timer app that has the ability to increment (up) for each subsequent repetition of the timer. The app is not complete, but it is useable; it's mainly the design/visual part that is unfinished.
This timer is originally made for tea-making, in the eastern style of *gongfu*, which involves frequent and short steeps with high leaf-to-water ratios in small vessels. Later steeps are done over longer durations. If you are into tea-brewing, you probably also have lots of different leaves, so this app also can save custom timer configurations, which is more convenient than memorizing all those unique timings that every different batch of leaves deserves.
## Using This App
Upon opening the app for the first time, a list of pre-made timers will be displayed. These can be deleted or restored via the Settings button in the upper right-hand corner.

You may add a new timer using the (+) Floating Action Button in the lower left, which will take you to a different screen. There are three required fields: Start Timer, Total Infusions, and Name.

Otherwise, if you just want to quickly start a new timer, from the list of loading configurations, you can hit the Play button in the lower right-hand corner. From here, you can quickly punch in just the Start Timer, Increment amount, and Repetitions. Only the Start Timer and Repetitions fields require a non-zero input. (The app will gate you from progress if there is an issue.)

After hitting "Start" from the third step, you may use the new timer. The lower right-hand button is for Go/Pause, and the lower left-hand button is for Restarting. You may also adjust the iteration, if desired, using the `-` and `+` buttons. And if you changed your mind and do want to save this timer in case you want to use it again, you can by selecting the pencil button in the upper right-hand corner.
