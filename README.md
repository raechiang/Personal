## Sudoku Generator
I used to play a lot of sudoku, so I wrote a generator kind of on a whim. It just uses backtracking. I did some light comparison of different board initiations over 55000 generations for fun.
## Consumables Chart Generator
This makes a pie or line chart. I had been collecting personal expenditure data for budgeting purposes, and I thought it would be nice to visualize the data, so I would graph it by hand, but that got old fast. Initially, I made a quick-and-dirty, ugly program that just got the job done, but it was messy to work with, so I ended up rewriting it, attempting to following the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) design pattern. Still not very pretty, but it's better.
## Gongfu Timer (WIP)
This is a timer app whose primary purpose is for me to get an introduction to developing mobile applications. The app itself is not complete, but it is useable; it's mainly the design/visual part that is unfinished.
