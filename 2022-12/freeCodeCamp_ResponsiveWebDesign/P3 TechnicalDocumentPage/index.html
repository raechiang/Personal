      <header>Introduction</header>
      <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
        Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
        environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
      <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
        elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of
        purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document
          Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form
          and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
        <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
          server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide
          continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on
          a server.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="What_You_Should_Already_Know">
      <header>What You Should Already Know</header>
      <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW)</li>
        <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</li>
        <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page
          about JavaScript</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript_and_Java">
      <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
      <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
        language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
        Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
        renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
      <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime
        system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a
        prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
        provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
        supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects,
        executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
      <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes,
        and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do
        not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
      <header>Hello World</header>
      <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
      </p>
      <pre><code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
greetMe("World");</code></pre>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
      <header>Variables</header>
      <p>Variables can store data values.</p>
      <p>The names of variables, called identifiers, must abide by certain rules:
      <ul>
        <li>They can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs</li>
        <li>They must start with a letter or with $ and _</li>
        <li>They are case-sensitive</li>
        <li>They cannot be a reserved word</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can also use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can use the Unicode escape
        sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are <kbd>Number_hits</kbd>,
        <kbd>temp99</kbd>, and <kbd>_name</kbd>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_Variables">
      <header>Declaring Variables</header>
      <p>You can declare a variable in four ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using <kbd>var</kbd></li>
        <li>Using <kbd>let</kbd></li>
        <li>Using <kbd>const</kbd></li>
        <li>Using nothing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The following are valid declarations and assignments:</p>
      <pre><code>var a = 5;
let b = 3;
c = a + b;
const d = 12;</code></pre>
      <p>Declarations do not need to be followed by initializations immediately except if you are declaring a
        <kbd>const</kbd>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Scope">
      <header>Variable Scope</header>
      <p>Javascript has three types of scope:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Block scope: If a variable is declared using <kbd>let</kbd> or <kbd>const</kbd> inside of a block (denoted
          by curly braces <kbd>{}</kbd>), then it cannot be accessed from outside of the block.</li>
        <li>Function scope: If a function is declared within a function, it can only be accessed from within the
          function.</li>
        <li>Global scope: If a variable is declared outside of a function, it can be accessed from all scripts and
          functions in the document.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
      <header>Constants</header>
      <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the <kbd>const</kbd> keyword. The syntax of a constant
        identifier is the same as for a variable identifier.</p>
      <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
      <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running, and it must be
        initialized to a value when it is declared.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
      <header>Data Types</header>
      <p>JavaScript has eight data types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>string: a sequence of zero or more characters</li>
        <li>number: a double value (64-bit floating point)</li>
        <li>bigint: an integer which is too large to be represented by a number</li>
        <li>boolean: a true or false value</li>
        <li>undefined: a value that is not assigned</li>
        <li>null: a special keyword representing the absence of a value</li>
        <li>symbol: a unique identifier</li>
        <li>object: a container representing many properties and methods</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="if...else_Statement">
      <header>if...else Statement</header>
      <p>An <kbd>if</kbd> statement will execute a statement if a logical condition is found to be true. An optional
        <kbd>else</kbd> statement will execute if the condition is found to be false. That is,
        <kbd>if (condition_is_true) { execute_this_statement; } else { execute_else_statement; }</kbd>.</p>
      <p><kbd>if</kbd> statements can be compounded with <kbd>else if</kbd> statements. For example,</p>
      <pre><code>if (a == 1) { val = n + b; }
else if (a == 2) { val = n * c; }
else if (a == 3) { val = n - d; }
else { val = n / e; }</code></pre>
      <p><kbd>if</kbd> conditions are considered in sequence and will execute at the first true statement.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="while_Statement">
      <header>while Statement</header>
      <p>A <kbd>while</kbd> statement will execute code if a condition is found to be true and will continue to repeat
        this code until the condition is found to be false. That is,
        <kbd>while (condition_is_true) execute_statement</kbd>. For example,</p>
      <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Function_Declarations">
      <header>Function Declarations</header>
      <p>A function declaration (or definition or statement) consists of the <kbd>function</kbd> keyword, followed by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the name of the function</li>
        <li>a list of arguments for the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas</li>
        <li>statements or code to execute, enclosed in curly brackets <kbd>{}</kbd></li>
      </ul>
      <p>For example, this function represents squaring a number:</p>
      <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
      <p>Functions can be invoked or called to execute statements on the given parameters.</p>
