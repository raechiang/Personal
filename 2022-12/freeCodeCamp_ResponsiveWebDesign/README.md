# freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Projects
This directory contains my five projects for freeCodeCamp's responsive web design curriculum [(link)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/). This taught me more about HTML and CSS, and I also learned to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes, which is important in a day where computers, tablets, and mobile phones are all used to access the web.

## Project 1: Survey Form
This is a simple app with different types of input fields and a bit of input validation.

One problem that I have with it is that the mouse does not change when hovering over the submit button.

## Project 2: Tribute Page
This is a simple app with an image that adjusts based off of the window size.

## Project 3: Technical Document Page
This app contains basic information about Javascript. It adjusts the navbar based off of window size.

I'm pretty pleased with this one because I put a lot of effort in button, formatting, and aesthetics. There is one thing that bothers me in retrospect. I chose to make the navbar two-columned when the window is small, but I think it would be better if it remained a single column. I believe my reasoning at the time of making it was that I did not like how the scroll bar looked in the navbar, but there are way too many section buttons. I think the navbar length could be shortened by dividing the sections into categories (ie. Variables, Control Statements, etc.), and the buttons functioned as hovering to open subsection buttons or as clicking to show subsection buttons.

## Project 4: Product Landing Page
This app shows off a product, Magic Frogs. The navbar and layouts are all sensitive to window size.

</p>

This was also a fun project for me because I played a lot with the aesthetics and made up a silly product. To improve it, I would have the top image resize with the window, since everything else resizes already.

## Project 5: Personal Portfolio Webpage
This is a personal portfolio webpage.

I looked for fancier ways to animate the button hovers because I wanted them to match my photograph of a moving flashlight.
