# Sudoku Generator
Upon running the program, it will attempt to generate 5000 puzzles.
## Example Output
The console will display the following:
```
......
Generations complete!
```
The program will create two files. One file is called `sampleOutput.txt`, which contains 30 sample boards. The other file is `stats.csv`, which contains three data points about each of the different solving methods: the type of method, the total time used to generate 5000 puzzles, and the number of successful solutions generated.

Here is one board:
```
8 9 6|4 5 2|7 3 1
1 3 4|6 9 7|8 5 2
7 5 2|1 3 8|9 4 6
-----+-----+-----
9 4 8|3 2 1|6 7 5
2 1 5|7 6 9|4 8 3
3 6 7|8 4 5|1 2 9
-----+-----+-----
5 2 1|9 8 4|3 6 7
6 8 9|2 7 3|5 1 4
4 7 3|5 1 6|2 9 8
```
